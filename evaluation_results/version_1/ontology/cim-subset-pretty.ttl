All generation and load within the area defined by the terminals on the border are considered in the area interchange control. Note that any number of overlapping control area specifications can be superimposed on the physical model. The following general principles apply to ControlArea:
1.  The control area orientation for net interchange is positive for an import, negative for an export.
2.  The control area net interchange is determined by summing flows in Terminals. The Terminals are identified by creating a set of TieFlow objects associated with a ControlArea object. Each TieFlow object identifies one Terminal.
3.  In a single network model, a tie between two control areas must be modelled in both control area specifications, such that the two representations of the tie flow sum to zero.
4.  The normal orientation of Terminal flow is positive for flow into the conducting equipment that owns the Terminal. (i.e. flow from a bus into a device is positive.) However, the orientation of each flow in the control area specification must align with the control area convention, i.e. import is positive. If the orientation of the Terminal flow referenced by a TieFlow is positive into the control area, then this is confirmed by setting TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag TRUE. If not, the orientation must be reversed by setting the TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag FALSE."""@en ;

The equations to calculate active and reactive power components of the load model are internal to the power flow calculation, hence they use different quantities depending on the use case of the data exchange.

  rdfs:label "RegulatingControl" ;
  rdfs:comment """Specifies a set of equipment that works together to control a power system quantity such as voltage or flow. 
Remote bus voltage control is possible by specifying the controlled terminal located at some place remote from the controlling equipment.
The specified terminal shall be associated with the connectivity node of the controlled point.  The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap changers.
For flow control, load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.
The attribute minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are required in the following cases:
- For a power generating module operated in power factor control mode to specify maximum and minimum power factor values;
- Whenever it is necessary to have an off center target voltage for the tap changer regulator. For instance, due to long cables to off shore wind farms and the need to have a simpler setup at the off shore transformer platform, the voltage is controlled from the land at the connection point for the off shore wind farm. Since there usually is a voltage rise along the cable, there is typical and overvoltage of up 3-4 kV compared to the on shore station. Thus in normal operation the tap changer on the on shore station is operated with a target set point, which is in the lower parts of the dead band.
The attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are not related to the attribute targetDeadband and thus they are not treated as an alternative of the targetDeadband. They are needed due to limitations in the local substation controller. The attribute targetDeadband is used to prevent the power flow from move the tap position in circles (hunting) that is to be used regardless of the attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue."""@en ;

cim:UnitMultiplier a owl:Class ;

  rdfs:comment """The unit multipliers defined for the CIM.  When applied to unit symbols, the unit symbol is treated as a derived unit. Regardless of the contents of the unit symbol text, the unit symbol shall be treated as if it were a single-character unit symbol. Unit symbols should not contain multipliers, and it should be left to the multiplier to define the multiple for an entire data type. 

For example, if a unit symbol is "m2Pers" and the multiplier is "k", then the value is k(m**2/s), and the multiplier applies to the entire final value, not to any individual part of the value. This can be conceptualized by substituting a derived unit symbol for the unit type. If one imagines that the symbol "Þ" represents the derived unit "m2Pers", then applying the multiplier "k" can be conceptualized simply as "kÞ".

For example, the SI unit for mass is "kg" and not "g".  If the unit symbol is defined as "kg", then the multiplier is applied to "kg" as a whole and does not replace the "k" in front of the "g". In this case, the multiplier of "m" would be used with the unit symbol of "kg" to represent one gram.  As a text string, this violates the instructions in IEC 80000-1. However, because the unit symbol in CIM is treated as a derived unit instead of as an SI unit, it makes more sense to conceptualize the "kg" as if it were replaced by one of the proposed replacements for the SI mass symbol. If one imagines that the "kg" were replaced by a symbol "Þ", then it is easier to conceptualize the multiplier "m" as creating the proper unit "mÞ", and not the forbidden unit "mkg"."""@en .

cim:UnitSymbol a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:label "UnitSymbol" ;
  rdfs:comment """The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the derived unit is equal to an SI unit. Whenever possible, the standard derived symbol is used instead of the formula for the derived unit. For example, the unit symbol Farad is defined as "F" instead of "CPerV". In cases where a standard symbol does not exist for a derived unit, the formula for the unit is used as the unit symbol. For example, density does not have a standard symbol and so it is represented as "kgPerm3". With the exception of the "kg", which is an SI unit, the unit symbols do not contain multipliers and therefore represent the base derived unit to which a multiplier can be applied as a whole. 
Every unit symbol is treated as an unparseable text as if it were a single-letter symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined by the accompanying descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit symbol.
To allow the widest possible range of serializations without requiring special character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate from the format described in IEC 80000-1. The division symbol "/" is replaced by the letters "Per". Exponents are written in plain text after the unit as "m3" instead of being formatted as "m" with a superscript of 3  or introducing a symbol as in "m^3". The degree symbol "°" is replaced with the letters "deg". Any clarification of the meaning for a substitution is included in the description for the unit symbol.
Non-SI units are included in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data to be correctly labelled with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor that is reporting numbers that represent feet instead of meters). This allows software to use the unit symbol information correctly convert and scale the raw data of those sources into SI-based units.

Note 3: a tripped element is synonymous to a tripped system unit.

Note 4: the type of a system unit is determined by its dominant component. The available system unit types are power transformer, overhead line, cable, reactor, busbar, series capacitor, shunt capacitor and SVC.
