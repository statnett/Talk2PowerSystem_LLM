# Troubleshooting Talk2PowerSystem Chat Bot Application

Synopsis: a document designed to help identify and resolve known issues with Talk2PowerSystem Chat Bot Application.

## Introduction

This document is designed to help troubleshoot the Talk2PowerSystem Chat Bot Application.
It [describes](#service-overview) the service, the [context](#context-diagram) in which it resides, and lists its
most [important endpoints](#important-endpoints).

The reader of this document should have the [prerequisite](#prerequisites) skills for the document to be
effective. [Known issues](#resolving-known-issues) and solutions are documented.

### Service Overview

The application is implemented in Python and uses Fast API. It's served with the uvicorn server.
It provides functionality for chatting with the Talk2PowerSystem Chat Bot.
It doesn't provide functionalities for:

- creating, updating or deleting chat bots
- conversations / chats histories

The chat bot memory is persisted in Redis.

The application can be secured using OpenID.

#### Context Diagram

Talk2PowerSystem Chat Bot Application depends on GraphDB, Azure OpenAI, Redis and optionally on Cognite.

## Prerequisites

Users, maintainers and testers who wish to effectively troubleshoot the Talk2PowerSystem Chat Bot Application must be
experienced with the following:

* REST (curl/postman)
* docker, k8s, helm
* bash
* GraphDB
* Cognite
* Azure OpenAI
* Redis

## Resolving Known Issues

### Issues

#### GraphDB health check status is not OK

Most probable cause: ["GraphDB can't be queried or is mis-configured"](#graphdb-cant-be-queried-or-is-mis-configured)

#### Calls made by the LLM agent to the tools `sparql_query`, `autocomplete_search`, `retrieval_search` are failing

Most probable cause: ["GraphDB can't be queried or is mis-configured"](#graphdb-cant-be-queried-or-is-mis-configured)

#### Cognite health check status is not OK

Most probable cause: ["Cognite can't be queried or is mis-configured"](#cognite-cant-be-queried-or-is-mis-configured)

#### Calls made by the LLM agent to the tools `retrieve_time_series`, `retrieve_data_points` are failing

Most probable cause: ["Cognite can't be queried or is mis-configured"](#cognite-cant-be-queried-or-is-mis-configured)

#### Redis health check status is not OK

Most probable cause: ["Redis can't be queried or is mis-configured"](#redis-cant-be-queried-or-is-mis-configured)

#### Users are experiencing slow responses

Most probable cause: ["Mis-configurations"](#mis-configurations)

### Causes

This section lists the causes of known issues and provides solutions.

#### GraphDB can't be queried or is mis-configured

##### Solution

- Make sure GraphDB is reachable from the app host.
- Make sure GraphDB credentials are correct.
- Make sure GraphDB timeouts are configured correctly according to the network performance.
- Make sure [GraphDB autocomplete index is enabled](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/11.0/autocomplete-index.html).
- Make sure [GraphDB RDF rank](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.0/rdf-rank.html) is computed and up-to-date. The status must be `COMPUTED`.

##### Verification

- Check the response status code of the `__gtg` endpoint, it must be `200`.
- Check the response body of the `__health` endpoint, GraphDB health check must have status `OK`.

#### Cognite can't be queried or is mis-configured

##### Solution

- Make sure Cognite is reachable from the app host.
- Make sure Cognite credentials are correct.

##### Verification

- Check the response status code of the `__gtg` endpoint, it must be `200`.
- Check the response body of the `__health` endpoint, Cognite health check must have status `OK`.

#### Redis can't be queried or is mis-configured

##### Solution

- Make sure Redis is reachable from the app host.
- Make sure Redis connect and read timeouts are configured correctly.
- Make sure Redis credentials are correct.

##### Verification

- Check the response status code of the `__gtg` endpoint, it must be `200`.
- Check the response body of the `__health` endpoint, Redis health check must have status `OK`.

#### Mis-configurations

##### Solution

- Make sure GraphDB timeouts are configured correctly according to the network performance.
- Make sure Redis connect and read timeouts are configured correctly.
- Make sure the application is not hitting [Azure OpenAI rate limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/quotas-limits?tabs=REST).
If it does, in the application logs there will be messages containing `429 Too Many Requests`. If this is the case, the rate limits must be increased. 
- Make sure the number of uvicorn [workers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/server-workers/) is configured according to the number of parallel users of the system.

##### Verification

Users no longer report slow responses
